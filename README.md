# lenemson/dotfiles

My dotfiles with quick installation scripts
and another script to manage syncing and updating.
I do not advice anyone to install it as is but rather
to look at the shell scripts if it can help you!

## Installation

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenemson/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"
```

Curl, Git, Vim and Bash must be installed.
